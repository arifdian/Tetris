# Introduction

A mock-up project with the theme "food delivery service" in mind. This prototypes are created using software/interface
called Axure with features that allows interactive content such as animations and data-driven interaction with clicks 
of a button. Moreover, that allows designer such as myself to use those feature to create a content friendly interaction
application that could follow the criteria of HCI to further be standardized as a "dummy" that could be applied in real-time
and society. 


# Features
* color-based content to easily differentiate between buttons and menus, hence creating a better interface for the user and
  also ease of use and less time to decide or navigate.
* Menus and sub-menus to better demonstrate the hierarchy to reduce the time taken to navigate through the app.
* Real-time data such as availability and ratings to improve usability and reduce decision making times making the app,
  an efficient tool.
